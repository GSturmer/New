    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p class="p1">
    Okay, so it won't be very often that you hear someone actually advocate throwing out everything you have ever heard about transparency. Unfortunately the vast majority of what is foisted
    on the general public is out of context, at best inaccurate and more usually in itself lacking in Transparency.
    <br/><br/>
    For want of a sensible starting point lets simply agree that if something is uncountable or cannot be confirmed then it is the opposite of transparent and belongs more to marketing and spin that actual Corporate Social Responsibility.

    From the simple negative approach it becomes clear that transparency requires 3 critical elements</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Simple headline KPI's</li>
    <li>Results with in built auditing capability and data sources available</li>
    <li>Appropriate level to the audience and auditing requirements</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="p1">
    Now very quickly have a look online and see if you can find any transparncy claims that would conform to the above.  Unfortunately the reality is that a fixed meaning for Transparency or metrics, have been almost entirely lost to the meaningless babble of the new age psuedo spiritualist marketeers.  Does any of the below describe anything you could measure?<br/>
    <br/>

    <img src="images/Transparency.jpg" width=100% alt="Transparent Traceable Transparency">


    <br/><br/>
    So there is the problem, Transparency is an attractive myth, and it will remain a myth until simple, clear and easy to follow metrics are adopted that ensure stakeholders and investors actually have the Transparency they are always promised.
    <br/><br/>
    We are going to do in these tutorials is start by defining a model for Transparency and from that we will develop and explain the Web application Theseus from end to end. This will result in the realisation that Transparency once defined and systemised in this manner turns out to be the most powerful business management tool in the tool box.
    And given that realisation it will also become absolutely clear that transparency is a management decision rather than a question of capability and as such it is for the owners, investors and stakeholders, rather than the management to define what level of transparency they require at the AGM.
        <br/><br/>
    What we will also discover along the way is that there is huge distruptive potential, massive opportunity for cost saving and major reputational advances to be had from managed Transparency. In fact it is the only possible future for all sustainable investments or brand identities in the information age.
    <br/><br/>
    You could say that the future belongs to transparent companies because they will blow the competiition out of the water in Investor friendliness and customer loyalty whilst at the same time delivering better bottom lines.
    <br/><br/>
    The best news is that since so many claims are made in this area I decided to make the web application open source. So its free and you don't have to pay anything if you can't afford it. Alternatively make your own copy and improve it and share it yourself. Feel free because ultimately transparency  is the pre-requisite of both freedom and justice so it should be avaiable to everyone.
    <br/><br/>
    My personal fascination is in the ability to use it to train under educated and under previliged people cheaply, but there is so much more to this program, such as the ability to comply to any certification or brand audit scheme with almost zero extra work than th normal day to day work of a any company
    <br/><br/>
    There are only two rules for its use.  You must consider the farmers or miners prayer (you will get this concept later on) and you should consider it open source and consider helping someone else, somewhere else implement Transparency.
    <br/><br/>
    For now lets get started with the 2D model of transparency.

    <h3>Linking Traceability and Transparency</h3>

    <p class="p1">

	The most critical step in understanding Transparency is understanding that without Traceabiility, Transparency is impossible in the globalized digital world. So it is entirely possible to have a company with open books that has simply moved all it's bad practices
	one step down the supply chain if the company it contracts with has closed books.  This may sound a bit extreme but it actually explains and is the cause of all the continued defforestation that can be attributed to the orders placed by global multinationals.
	<br></br>
	What happens is the orders are fed to a separate company and the corporate veil and a lack of traceability and transparency ensures that the value proposition is sound.  As soon as someone like Greenpeace defines the traceability as being directly attributable to the ccompany and defines the consequences
	of the processes the value proposition no longer holds and the process is either moved through  another node in the supply chain or changed. Fact is this is also the chosen method for the tax avoider and money launderer so
	it is extremly odd that governments have done little if anything at all, to close the loop holes during a period of intense globalization and technological development that has made the whole process much easier.
	<br/><br/>
	What these tutorials will absolutely demonstrate beyong any possible argument is that the technology and connectivity is already freely available to stop this nonsense.  It is both simple
	and cheap to establish mechanisms that make it impossible to cheat and defraud shareholders and stakeholders but that they are not employed because auditing legislation is behind the curve.
	<br/><br/>
	Stranger than global government in action, is the new phenomenon of trumpeting traceability as part of some certification process designed to respect and reflect niche consumer concerns and gain market. These psuedo traceability systems imply being able to check back in the supply chain
	is some improvement when it comes without any comparable metric, detail regarding what information is being disclosed or verification potential for the person to whom the information is being presented. This information is then normally little more than a redacted chain of invoices and delivery notes. In many ways these systems re worse than useless as they present
	a false view of a supply chain's potential problems to even the the very best brand procurement specialist. Using any information that is unquanitifed and edited comes with a risk, and if you look closely you will normally find disclaimers in place that render the whole idea of
	Transparency farcical.
	<br/><br/>
	So it is obviously a pointless excercise in transparency if the companies in the supply chain have differing levels on the transparency index.  In that case all that happens is
	that bad practice is concentrated in the the least transparent node in the supply chain. Which tends to mean the country with the most loose environmental rules and cheapest labour.  These lectures make no comment on social practice per se, the policy of any company regarding social and environmental justice and how they present it to their customers must be a matter for the directors and the sharholders
	and stakeholders, but it is the honesty and accountability within the auditing and reporting to which the most attention is turnned.
	<br/><br/>
	Even at this very early stage in the tutorials, what we can determine is that any metric for Transparency must include a metic for Traceability or it instantly becomes meaningless. At the same time a 2D model implies a straight central supply chain and in reality this is not normally the case. For this reason we need  3D model which we will discuss in the next section.

    <h1>The Supply Chain in 3D</h1>
    <div><img src="images/3d.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="3d Transpareency and Traceabiity"/></div>

    <h3>Traceability and Transparency in 3D</h3>

    <h4>Isolating The Central Supply Line</h4>
    <p class="p1">

	Shown in darker blue on the diagram the central supply line runs from raw material to retail, farm to plate etc etc. Given the whole idea of an efficient supply chain is to shorten it, this is more often than not the best place to start.
	It has also become a simple truth that in a globalized internet enabled world, final supply chain lenght is actually defined by three natural states</p>

	<ol>
		<li>A maximum value add at each stage has been acheived</li>
		<li>A maximum value add at each stage has been acheived, a restriction on free trade or has been over come, and or a marketing opportunity realised</li>
		<li>A maximum value add at each stage has been acheived, a restriction on free trade or has been over come, and or a marketing opportunity realised and a desired lack of transparency has been introduced</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="p1">
	In the first case the directors of all the companies involved have acted in the best interests of their shareholders and reduced the profit share to the minimum number of companies possible.  In this case the central supply chain represents  a set of companies where each performs the minimum number of unique proceses to form the product and increase its value.
	<br/><br/>
	In the second case all the first case influences apply, but local government or local market regulations or local market access requirements mean an extra presence is required to add value as goods move. Retailers, Auctioneers, Markets, Importers, Exporters and Wholesalers are all examples of companies that do not process but simply relocate items to a place where their value increases.
        <br/><br/>
	So there are actually just two types of company in the supply chain. Companies that process and those that do not.<br/><br/>
	In the final case a physically unneccessary transaction is created and injected into the supply chain to avoid regulations and increase someone's profit.  This is the number one: corruption, tax avoidance and money laundering system and often has many layers or shells.

	With current auditing it is almost impossible for anyone to see these ghost transactions, however what we will see very shortly is that this need not be the case and it is not difficult to isolate potentially suspect transactions once a Transparency metric is in place.
<br/><br/></p>
	<h4>Components</h4>
<p class="p1">
	In essence components are simply side branches to the main supply chain. They operate in exactly the same way as a central supply chain but produce products that are only used as material inputs in the central supply chain processes.
	<br/><br/>
	For now we will not go into further detail than that as our purpose is to define a metric of transparency and then systemise its application. What is important here is that a component supply chain runs from raw materials to the central supply chain.

	<br/><br/></p>
	<h4>Metrics for the Weakest link</h4>
	<p class="p1">
	As far as transparency is concerened the weakest link is what defines the level of transparency for the whole chain. It has to be that way, because what you cannot see is the obvious limit of transparency and if you cannot see it, you cannot know what it conceals. In our case, this is a very useful description and allows us to indicate our confidence.

	Looking at the figure above we can conclude from the infographic that in terms of the traceability we have
	<br/><br/>
	Central Supply Line[4,4]<br/>
	Component [2,2]
	<br/><br/>
	Meaning our central supply line "lenght" is 4 companies or nodes and with those we have travelled back from our retail product all the way to our main raw material.(4 from 4). At the same time our component "width" is 2 companies or nodes  which are also traced back to their raw material. (2 from 2). In both cases had we not reached the raw material we could easily have described the metric as [4,4+] or [2,2+] to indicate further unknown nodes.
	<br/><br/>
	This metric may not look very interesting but its use requires management to disclose if they actually have any idea at all what the the effect of what they are buying has, and on whom, and hence details exactly if they care at all about how the item's production affects the world.  It would thus be very difficult for any publicly listed company to explain to it's shareholders and customers why not.
	<br/><br/>
	The above are simply the metrics for traceability but they form the neccessary foundations for a full Transparency Metric. There is only one additional metric required which is the "depth" or data population metric.  In our diagram using the weakest link principle we have
	<br/><br/>
	Data population[1,3]
	<br/><br/>
	Meaning that we only have reliable level one data available equally across the supply chain.  We do have higher level data from some elements but that is simply because some of our suppliers are more transparent than others which has no bearing on the Transparency Metric.
	<br/><br/>

	For now I will simply state that there are only three levels of data-population that are in anyway useful. <br/></p>
	<ol>

		<li>External Standard Certificates or Certification</li>
		<li>Internal Financial Transactional Data</li>
		<li>Batched Process Level data</li>

	</ol>
	<p class="p1">
		And it is possible to define and detail levels of disclosure for each.  For now do not worry if this is not clear, as it will become completely clear once we have a fully developed process model to work with. At that stage it will also become obvious that these three levels  are ranked in the order in which it is easiest to self audit in real time.  Our system will ensure that it allows for each of these levels of Transparency and Traceability as our job is not to judge but simply to create a tool and share it.
	<br/><br/>
	What should hopefully be clear at this point is that, atleast in the abstract, Transparency is linked to Traceability and that a useful start for a metric of Transparency is
	<br/><br/>
	Supply Chain Lenght [x,y]<br/>
	Component Width [x,y]<br/>
	Data-population [x,y]<br/><br/>

	In the coming sections we will look very closely at data-population and we will see how developing a system capable of delivering Transparency according to a score unleashes huge possibilities. But before we get to that we can now define our principles.



    </p>
</div>

<div class="ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 1-5">


    <h1>Principles of Transparency and Compliance</h1>


    <div><img src="images/principles.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="Transparency and Traceabiity Principles"/></div>

    <p class="p1">
	If you have been following the tutorials then these statements of principles should hopeful just a rehash of the logical steps thus far.  The new element compliance is a catch all that simply opens the discussion of restrictions and the data-population level required for auditing.  Any system person will immediately note that in our system we find it easier to define what we do not want.  This idea of negative requirements is particularly useful if you are looking to use the system to reduce costs or improve environmental or social impact.
	<br/><br/>
	In any case hopefully its clear that "compliance" is "compliance to a set of defined restrictions" and the restrictions and their auditing drive the data-population requirements and hence the transparency requirement of the system.  Think of it as having to give the right people the right information for them to discover if you have acted in line with any given standard. Because the chosen Standard fixes the restrictions and by default the level of transparency required we will not fix any restrictions per se, what we will do is establish the ability to check any processes against any standard and to pass compliant items around. So in the next tutorial section we will define a set of generic restrictions to cover all possible eventualities and all posssible standards at any level of transparency.
	<br/><br/>
	For now it is sufficient to understand that every auditing scheme is based on firstly restricting what you can do, and secondly checking to see what you have done and whether it complies with those restrictions. This is usually a once a year historic activity that covers only one company and results in accounts being published that are already out of date. It is both expensive and inefficient and is in any case only as good as the auditor. But what would happen if real time auditing was possible. And what happens if included in the data is the potential for self verification of more than just the money?
	<br/><br/>
	What happens when you start to look at mass, energy, time, and money all inside a transparent and traceable system? Well the truth is if you have done it right you end up with one system which can be used to check compliance to any regime, improve efficiency, deliver genuine real time transparent reporting for shareholders and stakeholders with the opportunity to support, intervene and teach from distance.
	<br/><br/>
	So let's get on and develop our restrictions.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 1-6">

    <h1>Restrictions</h1>

    <div><img src="images/restrictions.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="Restrictions in Transparency and Traceabiity Systems"/></div>
    <h3> Restrictions define requirements</h3>

    <p class="p1">When you think about it, it becomes a statement of the obvious that to comply to any standard you need the relevant dataset and a means of checking. For this reason if we define a set of restrictions we immediately define a data population requirement. So restrictions are the basis of any viable system.  What appears at the outset to be more difficult to acheive, is a dataset that allows compliance to any number of different certifications or standards including the financial, without continual re-invention of the wheel.  Given entire industries have grown up to turn this wheel there is obviously a strong belief that there is no unique dataset that covers everything.  But let's just continue and see where it takes us. AT the same time it may also be wise to think about a standard set of data capture fields rather than the data itself which can capture any and all data we could possibly need.
 <br/><br/>
    In any case its good to bear in mind that there are ERP systems out there that connect every element of a company's operation, so really all we are looking aat doing is opening up access to such systems to everyone and extending the linkages across the supply lines in an organised manner which is capable of then to covering many companies, any restrictions, and any reporting requirements.
<br/><br/>
What we are also extremely interested in is what secondary capabilities such a system would have and what benefits it may afford to a user.
<br/><br/>
    For now let's keep in mind that restrictions can be negative or positive. For example the vast majority of environmental restrictions are negative in as much as they tell you what you cannot do or use, and what should not be present; rather than what you can do and what you should use.  A good example of a positive restriction is a requirement to wear protective clothing.  This forces you to do something (have them in stock and put them on) and hence is a positive action that can be checked. Positive or negative the information set required is the same and the search is simply to find if there are instances of the restriction being applied or not. Again this may not seem all that helpful but it is critical to remote auditing, management and transparency to been able to view that something is not present in exactly the same way as viewing that it is.
<br/><br/>
After you have viewed the video will have completed the introduction to transparency and have a sufficiently broad level of background information in terms of Restrictions, Compliance Traceability and Transparency to understand the metric. In the next section we will look closely at the four possible frameworks for compliance in the context of a [3,3][0,0+][0,3] supply chain. <br/><br/>

That's a three level retail to raw material supply chain<br/>
Central supply line [3,3]&nbsp    &nbsp    &nbsp   &nbsp with unknown and unrecorded<br/>
Component width [0,0+]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspand no current<br/>
Data population metric [0,3]
<br/><br/>
And just a note for the bankers out there, the Transparency metrics apply equally to financial products or derivatives. [1,7+] represents the usual central supply line traceability of a derivative before the crash. [1,7+][0,0+][[1,3] represents a bundled group of derivatives traded 7 or more times previously with a credit rating from a third party.

        <h1>Virtual and Physical Compliance Frameworks</h1>
    <div><img src="images/frameworks.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="Frameworks for Transparency and Traceabiity Systems"/></div>
    <h3> Working from the outside in</h3>
    <p class="p1">
      Many people believe that the virtual world started with the internet but in fact the virtual world has really been with us as long as there has been trade or more specifically trading companies or groups. Barter transactions (product for product) and product for currency transactions based on precious metals have a mass to unit element (kg/chicken vs kg/cow vs kg/coin for example)and a subjective market value element (value/kg chicken vs value/kg cow vs value/kg coin) hence there is are real and a virtual elements to all transactions and there always have been. It is however only really in the last 100 years or so that derivatives and currency values have changed from a real/virtual pair (kg of ...) base ultimately under the gold standard, to a centrally controlled virtual/virtual (promisery note of government promise) pair base. <br/><br/>

      The problem that a virtual/virtual pair base creates is that it increases the level of transparency required to be able to verify value.  All to often such transparency is not forth comming.  Take a recent transparency failure for example. In accounting it is normal to value stock at lowest of cost and current market value, but without verification of ownership of stock against time it's value can be faked, as Tesco shareholders will no doubt be able to confirm.  For our purposes at this stage we only need to understand that, to be certain of existence, and to be able to check value at anything other than a superficial level, we require a higher level of Transparency if the base is virtual.  This may not be completely clear at this point but ultimately absolute transparency
      can only be acheived with the inclusion of three real and one virtual element.
      <br/><br/>
      We can say is that the Data Population Metric for Transparency must detail the visibility, or lack of visibility of movements of not only Money, but Mass, and Energy, in Time, or it becomes impossible to tell real from questionable data.
      <br/><br/>
      Unfortnately due to a lack of metrics there are multiple standards in play, and none of them work on anything other than a trust basis because they lack sufficient transparency to avoid being able to be faked. The shareholder,investor, customer or stakeholder is actually forced to trust the Management and 3rd party auditors who are paid by the managers with the shareholder funds potentially. This is worrying because once metrics are in place and complete transparent dataset detailed and balanced in the standard double entry accountancy sense, there is no room for corruption or forgery left and companies instanty gain the capability to maximise their efficiency on many levels.
      No need to believe this statement just yet, but rest easy and note it somewhere for future reference, I am saying that if you set up to be transparent in your data system there are huge benefits to be had and you do not need to make aall the data available if your shareholders are satisfied.
      <br/><br/>
      What I am also saying is that there is no such thing as Transparency for stakeholders or shareholders currently. Because there are no systems made available which contain all the elements required to make a transparent time based, Mass, Money, and Energy Balance Sheet and P and L, across a supply chain.
      <br/><br/>
      All that anyone is really discussing when they mention transparency is how much data will be made available and how much will not without any metric against which to measure or any detaileed comparative disclosure in the supply chain. So you can move, fake or hide what you like. More on this later.
      <br/><br/>
      We should also not forget that companies themselves are also entirely virtual entities, they exist only on paper and are infinitely scalable inside a virtual legal world. Essentially the limit of liability is the widest and most accurate measure of the corporate boundary, consequently any discussion of transparency makes little sense if it does not start by considering the outer most virtual boundary before working its way to the inner most reality. Moreover if we look deeply and think about our models we can see hat Transparency,Risk and Compliance converge at the limit of each framework.  They do so at differing levels of risk and hence the frameworks are elements that the system must be able to incorporate if it is to be useful in any context.
      <br/><br/>
      In the next four sections we will thus look closely at the frameworks for each of the potential levels of transparency. In one form or another most companies use one or more of the levels already.  Most often these days there are clear differences between the requirements on differing levels in a supply chain with the majority of risk having been moved onto manufacture or moved in opaque entities offshore since the 1970's.  The fraameworks nest naaturally inside eachother according to their extent with a virtual extent being deemed larger than a physical one.  Peeling away these levels has the effect of increasing the transparency that could be made available to shareholders as you work from outside in.
      <br/><br/>
      In the first section that follows we look at risks which exist purely in the legal virtual world.  These risks exist at the very edge of the corporate boundary but as we will see, in the information age the risks are no longer limited to simple legal liability.
    </p>

</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 2-2">


    <h1>At The Corporate Boundary</h1>
    <div><img src="images/corporate.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="Corporate Framework for Transparency and Traceabiity Systems"/></div>

    <h3> Working at the boundary</h3>

   <p class="p1"> As you can see from the above image there is a boundary between the raw material supplier, the asssembly or manaufacturer, and the retailer. This boundary used to be solid and the corporate veil used to be sufficient to block any liability or consequences leaking up the supply chain.  Today this is absolutely nolonger the case. We live in an age where we are aware of our interconnectivity and fragility and have a global debate going on about the effect of industry on the environment.  Anything obviously bad in the supply chain is found, and publicised and the effects are normally reduced share values and reduced sales.  Today you can still protect yourself to some extent from the legal liability by you have little or no chance of protecting your reputation if you do not address issues in your supply chain
    that your clients or investors deem inapproriate.
    <br/><br/>
    It is critical to the study of transparency (and the principle reason that no transparency actually exists) that you do not get bogged down in the issues, or the rights and wrongs of what the data reveals.  The first step thatneeds to be taken in every case is to ensure that the company itself has access to all the data which could affect its value, and secondly that this information is made available to the owners and investors in an understandable and regular format.  CSR reports are basically so open to abuse that they have  become worse than useless. They sit entirely in the hogwash department and generally represent more risk to the brand reputation than they are worth. For now corporations get away with misleading information as we are just at th every beginning  of the age, but the trend to forced supply chain transparency and information activism is established and can only spread with the spread of the digital camera/video recorder and social media.  It is infact of no consequence whatsoever to a true student of transparency what the data actually says, this type of judgemental behaviour is a matter for the fashion politics of the age. But it should at the same time be very clear that your reputation affects your value and that what you don't know about yourself as a company in a chain can hurt you far more today than at any other time in history.
    <br/><br/>
      The first way in which companies try to manage these risks is at their legal boundary via the purchase order and procurement controls.  We have every type of example in retail from the "sustainably sourced" to the "virtually fat free" and essentially all it ctually means is that a company has a policy in place to control what it buys.
      So no great shakes. The policy will normally require the manufacture to agree to a number of restrictions of the type we have seen before with a yearly audit, and in certain key areas may even require that the supplier's suppliers also agree certain restrictions.  Truth be told the steps taken by many brands in this area do represent a move forward in terms of transparency but it's a tiny step rather than the leap claimed.
      It also comes with a huge elephant in the room . The PO and SO link has been in place and operating for centuries and the policies that define the specification and enhance the purchasing procedure tend to match the retailer's pereption of their issues. So very often each different retailer or brand will have its own ideas of what is important, which leads to massive compliance costs for the supplier. This inefficiency is actually being <a href="images/bsr.pdf" target="blank" >encouraged by people that should know better.</a> They are actually advocating moving away from a generic model and metrics and introducing variations and conseuently less transparency. But I doubt they would realise this </a>having never actually built a transparent supply chain or seen what it can do for companies.
     <br/><br/>
     The result is that the supplier will spend massive amounts of time and money on having to report different aspects of their business to different brands outside a common framework. They will then have to do the same for different environmental standards and the same for specific corporate reeports ad infinitum.  This is entirely due to the vested interests involved.  And it will be reasonably obvious to anyone not connected to those interests that if you could automate the disclosure to sny standard and make it available remotely in the format any investor, staakeholder,brand,retailer,auditor or customer could check it would then be far cheaper for everyone.
     <br/><br/>
     In any case no serious system can avoid the need to control at the PO and SO level and report the same as this is the entry level for compliance.
     <br/><br/>
   Ultimately it looks like this as the the PO is used to pass liablity down the supply chain or the SO is used to pass it up.

 <br/><br/></p>

 <div><img src="images/poso.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="PO and SO Framework for Transparency and Traceabiity Systems"/></div>

 <p class="p1">  Hopefully you will remember that supply chains are not straight line affairs and the PO SO system needs to reflect this, but we will show that complexity in the Component metric. Here
 we can define the<br/><br/>
 Data Population metric [1,3]<br/><br/>

 Basially its the Customer and Supplier details, and the all the data required to suggest conformity to a given material input policy, but be aware it is the most easy to fake and there are hundreds of examples where it has been that have cost retailers sales and credibility.
 Consider that for many years India exported more organic cotton than it grew. They exported it to western brands that sold it to the public.  Most people inside the trade knew about this problem in the abstract, but with a simple PO SO system there was no way to stop it. So no one did.

    <h1>The Environment</h1>

    <div><img src="images/environment.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="PO and SO Framework for Transparency and Traceabiity Systems"/></div>

    <h3>The Truth Hurts</h3>

     <p class="p1"> It may come as a bit of a shock but the Environment is inside the corporate liability boundary and outside the logistical framework.  The only reason that it is would ever be placed in any other position is because of there being almost zero transparency
    when it comes to dumping waste into the environment.
    <br/><br/>Now you may believe that it is hard to change, and at this level of Transparency and with the metering tools we have available you would be right Not only is it hard it is also very expensive.  The problem is that companies need to spend money on monitoring if they work at this level, and when they do, detection of releases of waste can only really lead to having to spend more money.
    At this level it's why tankers can still flush their tanks in the ocean and operate the next day inside the global economy. Without more information we can't apply the cost of cleaning or disposal to a single entity legally so every pollutant can actually be released with almost full immunity provided you are not transparent. <br/><br/>
    One could even make a very good argument that fidciary duty and environmental protection are at odds with eachother and they only really come into line when sufficent stakeholders of suffficient power have been suffciently affected to affect revenues or board positions.<br/><br/>

    Legislation on a global scale done at the same time, is unlikely, and enforcement costs more money than it saves. In fact there really isn't a single actual gain to be had, until legislation is in place.  So trying to manage your environmental risk framework at the level where it belongs is a fools errand.  Ultimately environmental risk management needs to be the result of deeper frameworks and not s separated framework in itself.
    The hard reality is, that unless and until legislation is applied equally globally there will always be a commercial advantage for countries that are willing to pollute. So there has to be a real profit motive in place for companies that can only be determined with far greater transparency because the one and only sure fire dependable way to manage environmental risk is through resource efficiency.<br/><br/>

    Another sad fact is that the level and the quality of the labour protections for workers that are hidden inside every product as well and they haave decreased in recent years.  Whole industries have been driven out of business in developed markets, due to lop-sided legislation that allows products produced in a way that is illegal in the home market to still be imported.
    So the question is what happens if the customer knows how the item was produced.  The answer is that no one cares, until someone tells them to care.  Then they care for as long as they need to care to conform to their social group. Sound a bit bitter and harsh? It is not meant to be, I really think bombarded as we are with information 24/7, even that much care is still amazing and wildly disruptive.  Losing sales due to negative PR from hostile scources and requests for ever greater transparency are still the order of the day,
    and slowlly it is becomming very clear that the best defense is the simplest, in that, you move your practices in line with your customer expectations and you move your customer expectations in line with your practices.  The thing is you can only do that if you know your impact and it is impossible for you to actually measure your impact at this level, because it is far too expensive and unlikely to be standard across your supply chain anyway.
    <br/><br/>
    So lets just put this framework on hold for a bit and carry on digging into the company.

    <h3>Logistically Speaking</h3>

   <p class="p1">If Data population metric [1,3] is customer supplier and order information then it stands to reason that Data population metric [2,3] is the data related to the movement of those orders.  In other words at this level we are looking at moving items from the real or virtual outward warehouse of one company to the real or virtual inward warehouse of another and including all points inbetween.<br/><br/>
   Hopefully by now its pretty clear that we always move items through the environment and that if they spill into the environment in say a truck crash  or the virtual product gets corrupted due to a faulty cable then the corporate liability will be decided, based on the ownership at that point or time, any leaked liability from lower supply chain levels and the purchasing agreements in place.  This all makes complete sense so again hopefully the mixed virtual and real framework model is making more sense.  Please do not these frameworks as anything other than useful models, in fact they are models which we are going to use to make another model.  It's fine to disagree but the proof positive or faailure will only really emerge once
   we test and audit the model against both the real and the virtual.  Whaat I hopee you aare seeing is that every piece of data I am considering is already available and I am simply organising my thoughts is a slightly different manner to come to something thaat can be applied to any circumstance required.
   <br/><br/>
   So we once again assumimg that the real and virtual are equally important we can then describe a delivery as an artifact (either real or virtual) accompanied by documentation either present or implied. Okay so an implied document sounds crazy but it's not.  In fact implied documents are the nemisis of the travel expense world.  All over the planet when cash is tendered a receipt is implied.  It does not mean you actually get one and it does not mean a delivery has not been made. It just means that as soon as you leave the shop you can no longer prove the purchase. In any case for our system to be valid in aall circumstances we will need the ability to produce and share a full set of documents.
   It's actually just the same information an auditor gets and its taken in the main from the PO or SO. There are a few rules on how to present this data, but why re-invent the wheel. A P and L and a Balance Sheet is widely understood and it's always good to share information in a common format.   At the end of the day this data is the most widely used company data on the planet, the only real difference is that we are thinking across a supply chain and wondering how we can ensure that compliance to any particular standard can be confirmed at distance. Anyone who is not intend on hiding, and happens to be reading this, might be beginning to see what an advantage allowing your investors to see your books in real time might be. It actually seems like a missed opportunity not to get their experience if they want to give it.
   <br/><br/>
   So an audit as currently mandated is supposed to check the value of a company from its records and confirm the quarterly reports or monthly P and L prepaared by the management. Other yearly audits check other things, but surely if an audit is possible once a year for any number of standards then it is also possible at any time for any number of standards.  So how could we be certain that we caan comply to any standard and move across any number of companies in our supply chain in the same way?
   Well the answer is to go one stage deeper into the company and look at everything as if it's part of a batch process.  To do that succesfully we will need a process model that respects the the myriad of concerns and certifications that we might wish to have. The process model must work equally well with real and virtual products and must be capable of being tailored for batches on any scale.

     <h1>The Process level Framework</h1>

    <h3>So what do you care about</h3>

   <p class="p1">If we are talking about a Data population metric [3,3]. Then basically we have to have all possible raw data available. I know that it sounds impossible that batch processing, linked to traceability gives you fully transparent supply chains which can be made to comply to any standard openly, but actually it can be tailored to that and so much more. This includes having totally remote control or a company and much much more.<br/><br/>
   When the model is tailored correctly it will provide you will anything you need for any report you want. Just ask yourself what do you actually want to know? I started these tutorials with the idea that Transparent systems need to produce easily understood data, so that is what I want. And if you do then deliberately define your process model in the simplest of terms you find it becomes vastly more powerful. You'll see that one system can be used for virtually all management requirements including teaching and sharing knowledge in real time.
   <br/><br/></p>
   <div><img src="images/process1.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="Corporate Framework for Transparency and Traceabiity Systems"/></div>
   <p class="p1">
   So we add everything we picked up from Data population [1,3] and Data population[2,3] and run it for a year so t0 to t1 is one year let's just see what we get.<br/><br/>
   </p><div><img src="images/process.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="Corporate Framework for Transparency and Traceabiity Systems"/></div>
    <p class="p1">
      As you might have guessed we get all the usual information for an audit delivered as one big process.  Once this is clear all that we are really doing, is deciding for ourselves what level we wish to share and when and to whom.
</div>


<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-1">
<h1>The Tool and Process Expansion</h1>

 <div><img src="images/tools.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="Corporate Framework for Transparency and Traceabiity Systems"/></div>
 <p class="p 1">
	Our goal in these tutorials is rather different to that of either the system developer or the Certification body.  We are seeking to prove metrics of Transparency are possible, and then consequently use them to guide the development of a management tool.   This tool can be thought of as
	an adjustable spanner. A tool that can be used on many different sizes of nuts. The developer is much more interested in longevity and single use tools that keep you coming back again and again. If you have been following to this point you will hopefully now be in a position to define the requirements of our tool as being those which allow the collection and transmission of data for all aspects of the following diagram.</p>

 <div><img src="images/ProcessF.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="Transparency Requirements"/></div>
 <p class="p1">
	The only thing that we need to remember at this stage is that there is further complexity and there is a reason why the system derived is called Theseus. Here we have described a short straight supply chain, however when we model a process in time and space there is no reason why we should only connect it to other processes inside the same entity. If we model it correctly and use a proper traceability algorythm then we should be able to connect it to all its antecedents where ever they occur.  Once we do that then just like the wool that Theseus left behind himself in the Labarynth, there is no problem in moving up down backwards forwards sideways or even looping in the supply chain because you can always just pay out more wool so you can always find your way back out. In the end you may not always be taking the most efficient path, but that's the point isn't it.  Once you know the route you can always improve it. <br/><br/>
	At this point we will do something that will annoy any IT department. We will expand our process model so that we have sufficient classes of inputs and outputs to ensure simple compliance information is easily managed at the most basic process level.  If you do wish to argue that less classes of data are required then feel free to do so, in your own field your most likely correct. The thing is the system is designed for use in any field and also to be used to train and support people regardless of their educational background. Simplicity ensures that they can perform complex functions within any certification regime without prior knowledge. So we expand the classes in the process model to allow complexity to be taken care of by the computer.</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-2">
<h1>Time</h1>
<p class="p1">
Perhaps the most important of the expansions is Time. Obviously the process time will have an effect on process energy etc, but there is far more going on under the hood in terms of how time can be used for auditing transparency across a supply chain. <br/><br/>  It is a simple fact that as soon as a supply chain traceability platform is in place time can be used to verify existance. Time defines when something happened and how long it took to happpen and since things happen in a regular organised manner in production you can spot fakes easily. <br/><br/>
A cow is pregnant for a set time  and faking a cow takes as long as making a cow if you set your system correctly.  Now it may be possible for one company to fake time records, but it becomes extremely difficult for two companies to do so and an order of magnitude more complex for three. The facts are that a transparent supply chain self audits according to time. <br/><br/> Time is and can also be used for many other purposes, such as validation of worker productivity or pay. Now any sound company needs to do that, but how many actually realise that if you relate workers to pay to hours to production batches you can eradicate child labour.  Obviously you would need to want to eradicate slave and child labour but it's absolutely possible using time based calculations and a knowledge of how long things usually take to produce. So all you actually need is that central supply line we defined earlier and an associated Bill of Processes and everythig becomes self auditing.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-3">
<h1>Location</h1>
<p class="p1">
The location expansion is not so obvious but it is extremely useful, particularly in schemes like HACCP.  It basically ensures that every process is a critical process. To do this we have extended a virtual and or a real input and output warehouse location on either side of every process. (these are siometimes called in-line warehouses)   Their presence in the traceability algorhythm allows us to ignore the corporate boundary should we so wish and to "teleport" anywhere in the supply chain with just the addition of a creative process, or a delivery note. Again whilst this ability might only ever be used in the exception, the fact that it closes the supply chain means inputs and outputs cannot simply appear or disappear without being noted as doing so. Other benefits include each individual process being an auditable microcosm of the company itself allowing value ladders, Batch P/L or accurate WIP calculations to be drawn. The location also allows knowledge of where a batch for a Sales order is in production at any time automatically if required. <br/><br/>In a lot of chemical storage situations location is used to reduce risk simply by ensuring chemicals which combine explosively and fire hazards etc are never stired together.<br/><br/> So by having a location at the start and at the end of a process we get a flexibility in modelling that is otherwise not present.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-4">
<h1>Inputs and Outputs</h1>
<p class="p1">
Inputs and Outputs seem fairly simple at first glance but actually as I mentioned earlier we will expand both of these and mirror them.  What do I mean.  Well taking inputs as an example every chemical formula or receipe has two classes of input. A key input and other inputs. The key input is the input used as the base for calculations. So you might need 2 eggs and 400grams of flour for a cake. Either ingredient can be the key input but if you are a chicken farmer your key input would most likely be eggs and if you are a wheat farmer it would most likely be flour.   Either way if you have 4 eggs you'll need 800g of flour to bake a cake that is twice the size.  Again if our traceability is to speak simply a Key input has a matched Key output and in this way we can define the central supply line. By doing so our metric can be easily measured by the number of key inputs or outputs we can define should we wish.
<br/><br/>
This is not the only expansion for inputs and outputs.  If you actually want to be able to speak process you will need six types of inputs and outputs within the two classes.  These are Materials (legally required for audit) Sub-products (secondary Central supply line info) Products (legally required at audit) Rejects (highly useful for resource efficiency) Waste (highly useful for environmental monitoring and resource efficiency) and Water (almost every environmental scheme checks this separately so you should get used to it). Each of these types caan be either a Key input or Other input in a process or indeed a Key or other output from a process and between them you will discover that you can maintain compliance matricies for any scheme.  Most information systems leave the categorisation to the item level which basically creates huge amounts of work and cost in a multibrand - multiproduct compliance environment.
</p>

</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-5">
<h1>Sub-products</h1>
<p class="p1">
The simplest description of a sub-product is an something that can only be saleable with further processing.  Many systems have this totally wrong because they are unable to send a product back into production. They leave mid production items that can be sold as sub-products, this is confusing, hard to audit and un-helpful for Sales people managers and production people alike.  So we use sub-products to deal with multiple outputs from the same process that all need further processing.  At the same time the key sub-product is the sub-product defined in Transparency Metrics for the supply chain we are considering.
</P>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-6">
<h1>Products</h1>
<p class="p1">
Product has a legal meaning.  It means something that has been made ready for sale.  Even if you are just a warehouse you bring in Materials and you sell Products in your accounts and the transformation is a process.  It could be a simple process such as putting the item out on display or it could be a huge chain of processes with many sub-products inbetween either way its still a transformation that has to be defined in the balance sheet and P/L accurately. <br/><br/>
As mentioned above a product is something that can be sold, but our system also allows it to continue in production to another product. This is both legal and sensible if the input and output warehouses are available.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-7">
<h1>Waste</h1>
<p class="p1">
There is nothing finer in terms of environmental management and resource efficiency than taking a waste and turning back into a product, a sub-product or an energy source. The Waste extension allows everyone to focus on the issue.  It is also a fact that where there are emissions they need to be put into a type and since they cannot be sold, and cannot be further processed they are clearly in need of a separate type.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-8">
<h1>Rejects</h1>
<p class="p1">
A reject may or may not become waste, it is simply an item that is un-fit to be included in a delivery against a specific salesorder, so it's not a product. By having this type separated it again highlights and focuses everyone on efficiency.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-9">
<h1>Water</h1>
<p class="p1">
Really this is just another input but it's such an important one in so many certifications that it is just better and easier to give it its own type.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-10">
<h1>Equipment</h1>
<p class="p1">
Whether you use equipment in processes to define the depreciation or the power consumption the facts are that most machines actually wear out with use, so it is a reasonably comfortable extension to detail anything that could be described as a tool in sufficient detail for all possible purposes during its use in processes. The implications for Health and Safety are not so clear but they arise from putting the machine into the process rather than actual use.  Sound crazy, but the fact is location creates risk regardless of whether the machine or tool is actuaally switched on or no.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-11">
<h1>Consumables</h1>
<p class="p1">
The consumable extentsion is basically there to be used to highlight things that go into processes and don't come out inside sub-products or products.  Normally useful for maintenance processes and for highlighting sources of emissions, they also are of interest in terms of efficiency and wastefulness.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-12">
<h1>People</h1>
<p class="p1">
Unless a process is fully automatic a person will be involved, this then is a key area of compliance. A process model that is incapable of detailing people at work is not much of a process model at all anymore, but all too often you will see people in processes being represented in terms of only their direct cost and productivity. There is so much more you can do and in reality productivity is related to training and morale. And morale is related to how well the company is treating it's people.  You baasically have a virtuous or a vicious circle in play at aany time.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-13">
<h1>Instructions and Controls</h1>
<p class="p1">
The thing about including instructions and controls at the process level is that it becomes absolutely clear where the limit of compliance and hence liability sits between the worker and his or her company. It is also a very useful way to ensure QC systems are being honoured. ISO systems require information to be maintained at this level so it's a good idea to have built in capabilities at the start.
</p>
</div>
<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-14">
<h1>Conservation of Mass</h1>
<p class="p1">
We have already ensured that things can't easily just appear and disappear in our supply chain but obviously if we apply conservation of mass at the batch process level everything becomes transparent. Why? Because it highlights losses into the environment, located personnel based losses such as theft and hiding at the point of occurence right across a supply chain making it extremely difficult to fake anything.  If you mass balance in real time and link to the financial data it basically becomes almost impossible to commit all types of fraud undetected. Over-paying for goods or services can still continue, but that is the only fraud that can and its easy to spot and stop once PO data is available.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-15">
<h1>Conservation of energy</h1>
<p class="p1">
At the end of the day CO2 footprints are basically a waste of time to everyone but the scientist trying to reduce costs. Well that is not really set to change except in regard to the complete impossibility of faking data, and the total possibility of automated auditing that results from a Mass Moneey aand Energy Balance Sheet.  Most, but not all, industrial environmental compliance schemes have an energy component so it's good to have it available in any case.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-16">
<h1>Accounting and the Environment</h1>
<p class="p1">
So where have we arrived with our full process model.  Well strangely we should be able to deduce that almost all the data is already available in one existing system or another.  And the audit really doesn't need much in the way of improvement just a few extensions and a format to review.  So maybe it's time that Transparency stopped being a myth and started being a tool. At the end of the day it will be shareholders that decide the future path of their companies.  Regulators and world traders should however pay close attention.  It is now absolutely possible with minimal cost to understand the social and environmental differences between products.  I think today it is still more likely that new businesses will seek transparency systems for the competative edge they can encourage over their rivals, but that does nothing to explain why public procurement is still almost completely opaque. For me the right to tax comes with the duty to represent, and the expectation that the representation is in the public interest. If you have nothing to hide then why would transparency be an issue.  End of the day companies and individuals wishing to accept taxpayer funds should be transparent at the project level at the very least.  It is not however for me or anyone else to decide what if any level of metric is relevant to private individuals or companies.   I will simply say that in the longer term, efficiency and brand openness are likely to define the winners and losers as the information age gains pace. Eitherway Theseus is free to use if you can't afford it.  If you can please make a suitable donation. As you might expect anyone giving a donation will be given access to our accounts to see how their money is spent. This will allow you to know exactly and to the penny what we did with your specific donation.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-17">
<h1>Health and Safety at work</h1>
<p class="p1">
Really this should be much higher on the list as actually the transparent environment is the end of hundreds of years of labour improvements which have recently reversed.  Multi-media applied at the process level allows clear and easy to follow instruction. There is no excuse not to ensure this happens in a world of streaaming video. Sure the kitten is cute but a life saved is better. Training is the key and delivery each and every time at point of need is good for the company liability, brand image and good for the worker. It can also be used to train people in new processes or assist farmers in dealing with any number of pest issues.  End of the day Transparency is the future and in the future you will be able to learn how to process almost anything safely.  If you work with your university and your certifier you need simply to follow their processes and procurement recommendations and you will be as good as anyone else.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-18">
<h1>Complexity</h1>


<div><img src="images/complexity.jpg" style="margin:10px;width:100%" alt="Complexity in Transparency and Traceabiity Systems"/></div>
<p class="p1">
These are four forms of complexity that have inherent brand risk and thus require a mention.
<br/><br/>
The Outsource.
<br/><br/>
When your supplier decides to outsource something that you think he is doing in house your whole compliance scheme can fall apart. Most traceability systems simply cannot handle such an issue simply.
<br/><br/>
The Re-Assign
<br/><br/>
This means your supplier takes somethingthat was originally in production for someone else under their rules and re-assigns it be be under your rules. This is hard to avoid without traceability. Commercial pressure with drive these occurences and once again they can have extremely unfortunate repurcussions on your image and the quality of your products.  A good system can make these problems almost disappear using Time, Sales Order and purchase information.
<br/><br/>
The Fix
<br/><br/>
This means aa process is stopped additions are made and the process then continued. Not really succh aa problem if you have a good restricted chemical policy in place but of note because the impact of a fix is to change the environmental results of a batch and can often deliver lower quality items.
<br/><br/>
The Rework
<br/><br/>
Like the fix only done after the process is completed, it has the added issue that it can often be outsourced or contracted in as well.
<br/><br/>
These complexities are of note because theey imply the need for a creative or on the fly element to the traaceability and acccounting system to deal with production problems. In fact you could easily say that without such a creative element any traceability system will fail and the only possible response is to revert to lower levels of data and generic procurement information.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 3-19">
<h1>Creativity</h1>
<p class="p1">
So in the end it all comes down to flexibility.  A system has to allow a company to do what it wants to do, and to record such events accurately if it is to be of any use to the management.  There are  many natural products that need quality adjustments throughout the entire production process.   There are also creative processes themselves. Unless a system covers these it is flawed. It won't always matter in terms of auditing but ultimately it is a fools errand to operate at a level of transparency you cannot maintain across the supply chain in all circumstances cheaply.  In fact you need an ROI for your transparency system and you are really unlikely to get it if the data input side is too pricey or does not deliver savings and efficiencies.  At the same time if you don't actually know what a transparent system can do for your company then you are not in position to decide a suitable level of implementation and you are missing a trick. Transparency is not a state of being, it is a management tool and it depends entirely on the shareholders which of its many benefits needs to be delivered by the management.
</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 4-1">
<h1>Transparency Limits of benefit </h1>
<p class="p1">
It may seem odd that and avocate of transparency is also cautioning about the beneficial limits of transparency, however on closer inspectiion you'll see that this is an implementation and optimal performance issue rather than a capability issue. In short the system has to be capable of delivering [3,3] level transparency before you can use it in a targetted way.  There are well researched papers that indicate that extreme transparency can come at the expense of creativity, which is great if you have processes which needs to be repeated exactly, but not so great if you wish to see continual improvement.   It does however turn out that you can introduce boundaries of transparency using our already defined model. Boundaries in time, physically in space, and virtually in observation and recording which can then be used to increase the efficiency of the creative process. To put this another way you need to set your transparency metrics differently for R&D and production.  If you can't do this because your system can't handle it  you cannot optimise your transparency or ultimately your business.  The following is a well researched example of why this is important. <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-transparency-trap" target="blank">Havard Business Review</a>
<br/><br/>
The article covers practical issues that affect productivity due to the perceived level of transparency succintly, but these are not the only issues that you need to consider.  There are marketing and Brand reputational value issues that must be treated in the same way as all other business decisions. And crucially you need to look at your marketplace and understand your customer expectations and your competitor position. Transparency is not the elixir of life it is often made out to be, both too much and too little can harm the business. The main issue is the lack of clearlly defined metrics in the consultancy marketspace which allows allsorts of claims to be made. Which ever way you look at it Transparency can no longer be ignored safely and the best possible defence a management can have is to implement a fully capable systems and then decide in consultation with it's shareholders which level of metric is most viable in the medium term</p>
</div>

<div class=" ui-content jqm-content hiddenContent 4-2">
<h1>Back to Theseus </h1>
<p class="p1">
Hopefully these tutorials have helped to give a behind the scenes look at Transparency and Traceability. There is however no substitute to seeing the system in action, adding some process level data and checking exactly how things might work for you, your supply chain, and your industry.
